# SS_Tindie
ShipStation and Tindie API Integration based on the work of https://github.com/NuclearManD/TindieAPI and https://github.com/natecox/pyshipstation

You will need your Tindie username and API key and your ShipStation API key and API secret.
Should be pretty self explanatory, but create a config.py file with:

T_username = 'Tindie username'

T_api_key = 'Tindie api key'

SS_api_key = 'ShipStation api key'

SS_api_secret = 'ShipStation api secret'
